Myspace Transport Plugin

Drop into your rails project and enjoy myspace photo import and export. 
The core of this is lib/myspace_mech.rb. Two example rake tasks for 
command-line import/export are included, as well as a monkeypatch to 
make Net::HTTP more failure-tolerant. 

Use of net_http_retrypatch is highly recommended (but not required) when scraping myspace.
